# AEFCO : A Machine Learning Based Covid-19 Dashboard

### This repo contains the project done in CSIR-Summer-Research-Training

The sole purpose of this project was to give the control of predicting the Covid-19 outbreak into the hands of common people. Machine Learning for everyone. The repo contains a code of GUI dashboard named AEFCO (Analysis, Estimation, and Forecasting for Covid-19 Outbreak) having Machine learning features. There are a plenty of quite intuitive graphs available with just a click and currently there are 3 models available for time-series forecasting- LSTM, Polynomial Regression and FbProphet. The user can use all these features without having much understanding of Machine Learning and Time series forecasting. The GUI was designed using PyQt5 designer.
